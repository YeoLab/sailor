# YOU NEED TO PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING THREE NECESSARY PARAMETERS


# aligned BAM file
input_bam:
  class: File
  path: ce11_example_single_end.bam

# reference file
reference:
  class: File
  path: ce11.chrI.fa

# known snps file
known_snp:
  class: File
  path: ce11_known_SNPs.bed

# ALL PARAMETERS BEYOND THIS ARE ADVANCED AND OPTIONAL
#
# leave as is unless you know you have a specific need to adjust something
#
# if you need to adjust something:
#
# 1) uncomment the relevant "key: value" line,
# 2) do not add any space or tab at the beginning ot that line,
# 3) modify the value to fit your needs
#
# for example if your bam is paired ends as opposed to single ends:
# change the following 2 lines:
#
#    |
#    |# determines whether or not this is a single or paired-end library
#    |#single_end: true
#
# this way:
#
#    |
#    |
#    |# determines whether or not this is a single or paired-end library
#    |single_end: false
#    |
#


# if this is a TruSeq reverse stranded library, set to true
#reverse_stranded_library: true


# determines whether or not this is a single or paired-end library
#single_end: true


# determines the minimal number of nt a read can overhang a junction
#junction_overhang: 10


# determines the distance from the end of the read that a mutation can occur
#edge_mutation: 5


# the maximum number of non-AG mutations that can occur in a read before it's filtered out.
#non_ag: 1


# minimum read coverage supporting a variant at any position
#min_variant_coverage: 5


# choose "DP" to calculate minimum coverage based on all postfiltered reads,
# or "DP4" to calculate coverage based on postfiltered+quality filtered reads.
# See: http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml for differences between DP and DP4
#dp: DP4


# Adjust these parameters to either add a pseudocount to G (alpha) or A (beta).
# Useful for relaxing parameters on lower coverage data.
#alpha: 0
#beta: 0


# hard filter on minimum edit fraction
#edit_fraction: 0.01


# keep all (100%) edited sites as true editing events.
#keep_all_edited: false


# skip_duplicate_removal:
#skip_duplicate_removal: false
