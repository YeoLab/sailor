This is sailor 1.0.4  (software for A-I calling On RNA)

Usage :
  rnaediting \
  --input_bam INPUT_BAM \
  --reference REFERENCE \
  --known_snp KNOWN_SNP \
  --junction_overhang JUNCTION_OVERHANG \
  --edge_mutation EDGE_MUTATION \
  --non_ag NON_AG \
  --min_variant_coverage MIN_VARIANT_COVERAGE \
  --alpha ALPHA \
  --beta BETA \
  --edit_fraction EDIT_FRACTION \
  --dp DP

Options:
  --input_bam (REQUIRED): input BAM file containing alignments to a reference genome (.bam)
  --reference (REQUIRED): reference genome in FASTA format (.fa)
  --known_snp (REQUIRED): tabbed 3-column file containing the zero-based position of known snps. Any SNP described in this file will be filtered out from editing site candidacy. 
  --junction_overhang (DEFAULT 10): filters reads that are split upon junctions that are not at least flanked by this number on either side
  --edge_mutation (DEFAULT 5): filters reads that contain a mutation that lies on the 3' end of the read by this much
  --non_ag (DEFAULT 1): filters reads that contains more than this number of non-AG (or TC depending on strand) mutations
  --min_variant_coverage (DEFAULT 5): hard filter that removes variant sites supported by less than this number of reads
  --alpha (DEFAULT 0): 'pseudocount' parameter. Use higher number for low coverage datasets (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution)
  --beta (DEFAULT 0): 'pseudocount' parameter. Use higher number for low coverage datasets (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution)
  --edit_fraction (DEFAULT 0.01): the minimum allowable edit fraction (higher fraction -> more stringent)
  --dp (DEFAULT DP4): filters coverage based on either the "DP" flag or the "DP4" flag in a vcf file (see: https://www.biostars.org/p/46361/)
